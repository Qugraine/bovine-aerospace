NEWS for rNOMADS

1.0-1
Fixed bug in GetModelRunHour and GribGrab that resulted in the wrong forecast times being returned.
GribGrab now returns file name, model run date, and forecast date for the GRIB file generated
GetModelRunHour now returns the model date in addition to the other things it already returned
You can now specify whether you want the previous forecast or the next forecast in GribGrab
Any code that worked with rNOMADS 1.0-0 should run with rNOMADS 1.0-1 without any trouble.
