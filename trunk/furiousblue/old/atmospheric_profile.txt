TO GATHER ATMOSPHERIC DATA FOR TRAJECTORY PREDICTION

1.  Determine how many data points are needed for profile.
On initialization of each program, we must download the entire atmospheric profile from 0 to 50 K because we do not know which nodes we are on.
After that, however, we can keep track of which levels we are near - and download smaller profiles. 
We need enough data to make a stable cubic spline, but too much data will unreasonably slow the computer down.


2.  Determine how many grid points to download.
The minimum will depend on what number of points the spatial interpolation program we need will use.

3.  Download model for back forecast and forward forecast, do a weighted average to determine exact atmospheric conditions that balloon is transiting through.

4.  Project lat/lon to cartesian grid using GEOmaps.

5.  Do spatial interpolation on each level to produce a smooth surface.

6.  Determine atmospheric profile of balloon position via cubic spline for each variable of interest.

7.  Use spline function to determine exact conditions at balloon.

Redo steps 6-7 if:
The position of the object tracked is X kilometers away from its position when the profile was first calculated
this keeps track of spatial changes of variables

Redo steps 1-6 (excluding total profile download) if the following occurs:
MODEL TIMEOUT (i.e. we should update the model every X seconds to keep of temporal changes)
OR
object crosses model boundaries
